# API-Blog
My first API Blog with a lot of interesting content!

API's are Application Programming Interfaces which are set of rules or certain protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
My API Blog will give us a brief overview of what an API is like. We can create and post our ideas using the API.
Node js,EJS,javascript and middleware have been used in this project!
